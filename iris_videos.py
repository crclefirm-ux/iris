"""
iris_videos.py — ESP32 video-clip awareness for the IRIS chat.

Why it exists:
  The Stream tab already receives .avi clips from the ESP32 and saves them to
  disk, and iris_fusion already runs face recognition over their keyframes.
  But nothing ever *recorded* what was found, and the chat tab only ever
  indexed audio recordings (see RecordingStore in iris_gui.py, which filters
  on _AUDIO_EXTS). So when the user asked "how many people were in that
  video?", the assistant answered that it had no access to video recordings —
  because, as far as the chat context was concerned, they didn't exist.

  This module fixes that by owning the "video" half of what iris_photos.py /
  iris_sessions.py already do for photos and chat history:

    • it finds the saved clips on disk (the Stream-tab save folder, the
      per-person people_store/<id>/sessions folders, and the usual project
      sub-dirs),
    • it reads / writes a small JSON sidecar next to each clip
      (<clip>.video.json) holding the analysis — how many distinct people
      were seen, their recognised names, duration, frames sampled, and how
      the count was obtained, and
    • it can analyse a clip on demand: preferring the real iris_fusion /
      DeepFace pipeline (which also yields names and feeds the People
      registry, exactly like the live path), and falling back to a
      dependency-light OpenCV face/upper-body detector when fusion isn't
      loaded — so existing clips captured before this feature can still be
      answered about.

Pure-ish Python: OpenCV (cv2) is imported lazily and every path degrades
gracefully, so importing this module never breaks the app even on a machine
without cv2 or without the fusion backend.
