"""
iris_voices.py — voice-print → people-registry bridge (M5 Stage 3).

Gap 1 / Gap 3 fixes vs original:
  - _process_one_cluster was at module level (indentation bug) — now
    correctly indented as a method of VoicePipeline.
  - Added _is_placeholder_name() staticmethod that _process_one_cluster
    references but that didn't exist in the class.
  - No other logic changes — all matching, reinforce band, name bridging,
    and idempotent marker behaviour is identical to the original.

Reads the diarizer's output and feeds it into iris_people.PeopleStore.
No heavy model load here — the expensive SpeechBrain inference already
happens inside diarizer_phase9.Diarizer. We just consume the byproducts:

    <stem>.wav                 (audio)
    <stem>.json                (whisper transcript + diarizer labels)
    <stem>.embeddings.npz      (one 192-dim ECAPA voiceprint per cluster)

Off-limits siblings — DO NOT modify from here:
  - diarizer_phase9.Diarizer      (we read its output, never edit it)
  - speakers_phase9.SpeakerDB     (diarizer's own audio-only registry)
  - transcriber, summarizer, ring buffer, wifi reader
  - iris_gui.py, terminal.py, ESP32 firmware
  - iris_photos.py, iris_sessions.py
  - iris_people.py and iris_faces.py from earlier M5 stages
